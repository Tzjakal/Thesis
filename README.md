# Thesis: Adaptive Animation
<img width="100%" src="Screenshots/System.png">

The system proposed in this thesis, describes a colision avoidance technique, using the FABRIK (Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) algorithm, combined with the necessary rotation limits. The whole system is built on Sebastian Starkeâ€™s Demo (https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation/tree/master/AI4Animation/SIGGRAPH_2018) with Unity3D and Final IK,  as  a  continuation  of  their  research. The characters can avoid obstacles of various sizes in realtime, while maintaining their original motion produced from the design of the previous system.

Using the tools developed for the demo (C# code), new features were added to the project. The user now controls a humanoid character (Adam) and has the wolf as his companion. The latter follows Adam wherever he goes and catches the ball Adam throws, while avoiding obstacles in his path.

The system can be extended to work with biped characters too. Two differnt examples where examined where Adam avoids objects of different sizes.
